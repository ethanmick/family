      <p>Hello ðŸ‘‹,</p>
      <p>
        Welcome to <strong>Family</strong>. I've spent the last 10 years
        building software that I, my partner, and now my family might want to
        use. Each attempt was picking away at a larger nagging problem.
      </p>
      <p>Am I really running my family life optimally?</p>
      <p>
        It wasn't until recently that I thought of the complexity of family life
        as an engineering problem. One that could be broken down and worked on
        the same way a complex system is.
      </p>
      <p>And trust me... family life is a complex problem.</p>
      <p>
        My wife and I just had our first son. A bundle of joy and also a world
        of logistical problems. More food planning, more checkups, more chores,
        more work, and more responsibilities. And as many of you know, this
        doesn't scale linearly with kids. Each additional child increases the
        complexity of the system exponentially.
      </p>
      <p>
        On top of the everyday tasks of running a family there are the longer
        term aspects as well. Are we being healthy? Are we financially secure?
        Are we on track to meet our goals? What <em>are</em> our goals? These
        questions need to be thoughtfully considered and planned for.
      </p>
      <p>
        And lastly, there is the human aspect. The relationships that created
        this entire family in the first place. The love that you feel and the
        conversations you have. The quiet time when the kids have gone to bed
        and you get to chat with your loved one. These moments need to be
        guarded and cherished. They don't happen organically.
      </p>
      <p>
        This product won't magically fix problems. But I hope it helps reduce
        your stress and aligns you and your family on the important moments.
      </p>
      <p>I know it has for me.</p>
      <p>Thank you,</p>
      <p>- Ethan</p>
